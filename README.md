# Python Merge Sort Algorithm

This is a basic Merge Sort algorithm built Python. It takes an unsorted list of integers of n length, and returns a new list of n length with those integers sorted.

## Running the algorithm

To run this algorithm on a custom list of numbers:

Edit the list ```n``` in ```$Python Merge and sort.py``` to the unsorted list you wish to sort.

```
n = []
```
Then run the python file.
```
$Python Merge and sort.py
```
